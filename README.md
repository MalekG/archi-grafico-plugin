archi-grafico-plugin
====================

Allow to load/save a model in GRAFICO (Git fRiendly Archi FIle COllection). GRAFICO is a way to persist an ArchiMate model in a bunch of XML files (one file per ArchiMate element or view).

This is currently a work in progress and not usable in production.
